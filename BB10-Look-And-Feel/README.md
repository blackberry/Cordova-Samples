## Getting Started with PhoneGap & Cordova

To use this sample, refer to the [Getting Started With BlackBerry guide](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/guide_getting-started_blackberry_index.md.html#Getting%20Started%20with%20BlackBerry) which will take you through the entire setup, and building process.

## Porting Resources 

If you're porting an existing PhoneGap application over to BlackBerry 10 refer to [Porting your existing PhoneGap app to BlackBerry 10](http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Web-and-WebWorks-Development/Porting-your-existing-PhoneGap-application-to-BlackBerry-10/ta-p/2070503) for lots of helpful information.

## Using this sample

This sample shows you how to get that BlackBerry 10 look and feel from an HTML5 app.  We're making use of PhoneGap's Camera API, and the BlackBerry 10 [Invocation Framework](https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/apis/blackberry.invoke.html).  Sharing the photo via the Invocation Framework will allow the user to connect with a variety of different applications installed on the phone.

## The code

Here's a quick glimpse at what we're doing in the app...

**Invoke the camera**

First, we invoke the camera using the PhoneGap API

```
function invokeCamera() {
  var cameraOptions = {
    destinationType: Camera.DestinationType.FILE_URI
  };

  navigator.camera.getPicture(

    // success
    function(path) {
      resizePhoto('file://' + path);
    },

    // failure
    function(message) {
      toast("error " + reason);
    },

  // options
  cameraOptions);
}
```

**Resize the photo**

Next, we resize the photo because nobody wants to see your enormous 10000x10000 pixel image on their Facebook wall.  Also, making it smaller will decrease the bandwidth, and time, used to transfer it.

```
function resizePhoto(path) {
  var canvas = $('#theCanvas').get(0);
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  var image = new Image();
  image.src = path;
  image.onload = function() {
    canvas.width = 720;
    canvas.height = 1280;
    ctx.drawImage(this, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    savePhoto(canvas);
  };
}
```

**Saving the photo**

[Erik Oros](http://github.com/oros) has written a great sample that shows how to save HTML5 Canvas data to the filesystem.  Check out [Canvas-to-Filesystem](https://github.com/oros/BB10-WebWorks-Samples/tree/master/canvasToFilesystem) for more info.

**Invoke Sharing Targets**

Last, we are using the BlackBerry 10 [Invocation Framework](https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/apis/blackberry.invoke.html) to display a list of apps which you can share the photo with. Check-out the [shareTargets](https://github.com/blackberry/BB10-WebWorks-Samples/tree/master/ShareTargets) sample for more info on using the framework.

```
function invokeShare() {
    var request = {
      action: 'bb.action.SHARE',
      uri: 'file://' + savedFilePath,
      target_type: ["APPLICATION", "VIEWER", "CARD"]
    };

    blackberry.invoke.card.invokeTargetPicker(request, "Sharing is caring",

    // success callback
    function() {
    },

    // error callback
    function(e) {
    });

  }
}
```
